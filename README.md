# Predicting Customer Churn in a Bank
## Business Understanding
### Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for the bank, enabling the organization to identify customers at risk of leaving. By understanding churn drivers and predicting future churn, the bank can implement proactive retention strategies, optimize customer satisfaction, and reduce revenue loss. This project will follow the CRISP-DM method. 
### Business Problem:
Customer churn is a critical issue for banks, directly impacting profitability and growth. Acquiring new customers is significantly costlier than retaining existing ones. Therefore, it is essential for the bank to predict which customers are likely to churn and understand the factors influencing their decisions. In this case we will look at the ABC Multinational Bank dataset.
### Objectives
This Project aims to:
1. Provide inferential statistics and visualisations based on this data.
2. Create predictive, supervised learning models from the data to predict churn.
3. Investigate labeled data on 10000 customers who have held accounts with the bank.
## Data:
This project utilises data from the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravtopre/bank-customer-churn-dataset dataset from Kaggle.
